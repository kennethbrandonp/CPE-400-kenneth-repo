# How to Run SpyOT application

## Project Setup

First you want the libraries we'll be using so plug this command into ther terminal:

```sh
python -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, hit "run" in the IDE while main.py is open. That should run the application.

## Path Handling

Make sure you have both Wireshark and Nmap downloaded:

```sh
Wireshark download: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
```


```sh
Nmap download: https://nmap.org/download
```

If you continue to have problems with these libraries, make sure their path's are set in the environment variables on your local computer:

```sh
  Go to your start menu and type: "Edit environment variables for your account"
  Go to: Path -> Edit -> Browse -> Program(x86) 
  Choose folders for either Wireshark or Nmap (Depending on which one you're setting the path for)
  Click "OK" until you're closed out of all "Edit environment variables for your account" windows.
 ```

Beyond this, there is no other troubleshooting that needs to be done. The application should run. If it does not, refer to the CPE 400 Project Report on Details and results for an example of it running:

```sh
